# Deployment & Setup Instructions

This guide helps you deploy the Ubuntu VM and configure Azure Sentinel to collect logs for the Global Attack Research Project.

---

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with permissions to create VMs and Log Analytics workspaces.
- Azure CLI installed locally or use [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/).
- Basic knowledge of Azure Portal and KQL.

---

## Step 1: Deploy Ubuntu VM

1. Use the ARM template located in `azure-ubuntu-vm-template.json` or deploy manually:

```bash
az group create --name attack-research-rg --location eastus
az deployment group create --resource-group attack-research-rg --template-file deployment/azure-ubuntu-vm-template.json
Ensure the VM has a public IP and SSH port (22) open to receive incoming connections.

Step 2: Set Up Azure Sentinel & Log Analytics
Create a Log Analytics workspace or use an existing one:

bash
Copy
Edit
az monitor log-analytics workspace create --resource-group attack-research-rg --workspace-name attack-research-law
Enable Azure Sentinel on the Log Analytics workspace via Portal or CLI.

Step 3: Connect VM Logs to Azure Sentinel
In the Azure Portal, navigate to your VM's Diagnostics settings.

Enable and configure sending Syslog and Security logs to the Log Analytics workspace.

Step 4: Import KQL Queries & Workbook
Open Azure Sentinel and go to Logs.

Paste or import KQL queries from the kql-queries/ folder.

Import the attack map workbook JSON from kql-queries/attack-map-workbook.json to visualize global attack sources.

Step 5: Monitor and Analyze
Use the dashboards to monitor attack traffic and patterns.

Adjust queries and workbooks to refine threat detection.

Notes
Ensure the environment is strictly isolated to avoid any risk.

Review Azure pricing to monitor costs during testing.
